Recettear + Auto-Diablo
Player does not control adventurers
Adventurers have personality traits that govern how they explore
Player manages different town buildings
    Blacksmith - weapons/armor
    Tavern - rumors for influencing adventurer behavior
        - unlock forming parties
    Temple - healing/resurrection
    Alchemist - potions
    Mage Tower - spells

Adventurer attributes
    Accuracy - roll equal or higher on d10 to hit
    Strength - damage after hit
    Evasion - add this to enemy accuracy
    Luck - add this to crit range (crit = double damage and +1 courage)
    Speed - higher speed goes first
    Intelligence - magic
    Courage - how likely they are to continue
        - flat number like KD survival

When courage is depleted, hero will try to retreat.
If in combat, must roll to escape.  Roll under Evasion + Speed + Luck - enemy speed - enemy evasion - enemy luck

Player cannot see the dungeon map at first, must intuit based on adventurer reports

Use Kingdom death combat system?
    - a KD severe wound lowers courage

Rooms
    Size - bigger rooms allow different numbers/sizes of monsters

Dungeon is made up of different regions, like DCSS, each with its own encounter table.
More regions possible than show up in any given run, so players will need to figure out
which regions are present and in what order.
Different regions will require different approaches. Catacombs have lots of undead which
need maces and holy water, etc.
